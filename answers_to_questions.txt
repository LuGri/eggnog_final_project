Which genes are universally required for an organism to survive? Being
more precise: Which genes (OGs) occur in at least 99% of all genomes in
the eggNOG5 database in each domain of life, respectively? (The results
should be around 100-300.)
How many such genes did you identify in each domain?

- 123 cogs for bacteria
- 175 cogs for archaea
- 273 cogs for eurkaryota
- results obtained with "wc -l filename" and substracting 1 because
of the header line

2. Which common bacterial genes occur almost exclusively as single-copy
genes? Being more precise: Which OGs occur in at least 50% of all bacterial
genomes, and in at least 99% thereof as single-copy?
How many of these OGs were also identified as universal bacterial OGs?

- 40 cogs with occurence 99% and 99% as single copy
- result obtained with "wc -l cogs_bacteria_o99_u99.txt" and
substracting 1

3. Identify all OGs that occur as single-copy in at least 97% of all Archaea.
It would be interesting to know if there are archaeal genomes which
substantially deviate from this “default” archaeal gene set. Are
there Archaea which lack 4 or more of these universal OGs? Which
organism (scientific name) lacks most? What is its
preferred growing temperature/environment? 

- Yes, there are 6 Archaea which lack 4 or more of these 121 important
OGs. The one which lacked the most has the Taxid 70601 (7 missing).
- Taxid 70601 is Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=70601) 
- Preferred environment: Anaerobic, temperature between 85°C and 105°C,
optimally at 98°C
